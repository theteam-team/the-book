% ABSTRACT

\abstract
\thispagestyle{empty}

\noindent
\textbf{Context}. Nowadays, there is a continuous increase in the 
number of businesses, firms, and companies. A company or a firm 
comprises several departments such as manufacturing, sales, marketing, 
logistics, and accounting. The overall performance of a business, 
crucially, depends on how well such processes are interacting. As a 
company or a business grows, the needs of the company also grow, and 
handling different systems and processes gets more complex. Therefore, 
there is an urgent need for the automation of the businesses in order to 
achieve their goals under the supervision of the users. The ultimate goal 
is to ensure products are well made and delivered to customers in time. 
Unfortunately, the available solutions are prohibitively expensive and 
cannot be afforded by start-up businesses or already existing small or 
medium-sized businesses.
\newline \newline
This project attempts to solve this problem by integrating two 
solutions for business processes: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
and Business Process Management (BPM). An ERP software system supports 
the execution of business processes by integrating tasks related to sales, 
marketing, manufacturing, logistics, and accounting throughout a business. 
In addition to this cross-functional integration, companies connect their 
ERP systems to coordinate business processes with their customers and 
suppliers. On the other hand, BPM focuses on capturing and improving 
business processes to make an organization more efficient. This is 
achieved by first capturing organizationsâ€™ current state end-to-end 
processes and then documenting the steps in process maps. While the 
ERP job cares more about cross-functional integration and tends to be 
limited to organizational functions, BPM job tends to be much more process-focused.
